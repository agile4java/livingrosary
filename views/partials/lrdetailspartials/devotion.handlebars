    <h4 class="my-4 font-weight-bold">Living Rosary Devotion</h4>

    <p class="black-text">


        We are here today to speak to you about a worldwide devotion called
        the
        “Living Rosary”. It is the Rosary in its entirety, but is prayed in
        a
        different format. You do not need to meet with a group of people,
        you
        can pray individually as an adult or young person anytime of the day
        or
        night at your own convenience. However if you desire, it can be
        prayed
        together as a husband and wife, or as a family with your children,
        or
        teachers with their student’s in our Catholic schools & CCD classes,
        it’s a wonderful way to teach the children how to pray the Rosary.
        This
        rosary can be prayed by itself, or included with the rosaries,
        chaplets
        or private prayers that we pray on a daily basis. This rosary
        devotion
        is very do-able on a daily basis, and we assure you that it will be
        Spiritually very beneficial for you and your family.

        Each person who joins will be assigned to a specific decade or
        mystery
        of the rosary. You will only pray one decade of the rosary every
        day,
        that is it. It is that simple!!! For example - let’s take the Joyful
        Mysteries, if you are assigned the first decade, you would pray the
        beginning prayers, The sign of the Cross, The Apostles Creed, The
        Our
        Father, The Three Hail Marys and The Glory Be. Then you would pray
        and
        meditate slowly on the1st Joyful Mystery(The Annunciation) 1 Our
        Father,
        10 Hail Marys, Glory Be and the Fatima Prayer (O’ My Jesus).That is
        it,
        you are finished for the day. But you pray this decade the same
        exact
        way every single day for 1 month.
        Then the 1st day of the 2nd month you would switch to the 2nd Joyful
        Mystery (The Visitation ), pray 1 Our Father, 10 Hail Marys, Glory
        Be
        and O’ My Jesus. Pray this decade the same exact way every single
        day
        for the entire month.

        The 1st day of the 3rd month switch to the 3rd decade, pray this
        decade
        the same exact way every day for the entire month.

        The 1st day of the 4th month switch to the 4th decade, the 1st day
        of
        the 5th month switch to the 5th decade, and end with the Hail Holy
        Queen
        prayer, this completes the Rosary.
        So by praying the Rosary in this fashion it will take you 5 months
        to
        pray one rosary this way and it will take you 20 months to pray all
        4
        Mysteries of the rosary. After completion of the 20 month schedule,
        you
        would start at the beginning again. That is why it is called The
        “Living
        Rosary”. It lives on and on and on.

        One of the beautiful parts about this devotion is the Meditations
        that
        are included with your schedule. Before you pray your assigned
        decade,
        you find the Meditation on your sheet, read it and while you are
        praying
        your decade meditate on what you have read. We feel the whole
        meaning of
        this way of praying, is to empty and quiet our hearts from the ways
        of
        the world, so we can be drawn more intimately into the lives of Our
        Lord
        and Our Lady, and receive the love, peace and joy from Them, that we
        can’t obtain from the worldly things.

        Also we have included a few suggested intentions. We ask you to
        please
        pray for our Holy Father, all of our beloved Cardinals, Bishops,
        Priests, Deacons & religious throughout the entire world, for
        vocations,
        for all of the
        pro-life endeavors, for all of the Spiritual and temporal needs of
        your
        own Parish. But the real beauty and power that makes this Rosary so
        special, is that there are millions of people around the world who
        are
        praying this devotion, they pray for all of your own personal
        heartfelt
        intentions, while you pray for theirs, so you are praying together
        in
        unity as one family.
        It is very, very powerful.

        Upon joining you will receive 3 sheets of information . The 1st
        sheet
        will be your 20 month schedule from top to bottom, and when you
        finish
        at the bottom of your schedule, you start over again at the top. (It
        is
        a life time commitment) The 2nd sheet is an explanation on how to
        pray
        this Living Rosary, along with the suggested intentions at the
        bottom,
        and the 3rd sheet front and back are all the meditations that go
        along
        with each individual decade that you pray.

        The “Living Rosary” History
        This Living Rosary is not a new devotion. It was started in 1940
        during
        WWII, in Krakow, Poland. As the Nazis were arresting the Salesian
        Priests, these priests asked Catholic layman, Jan Tyranowski, to
        gather
        groups of 15 youth to pray the 15 decades (which are now 20). These
        groups were called Living Rosary Circles, who prayed for their
        freedom
        and families and were able to pray this 1 decade no matter where
        they
        fled to.
        From this 1st group of 15 youth, 10 became priests. One of these
        priests
        name was Fr. Karol Wojtyla, who is now our beloved St. Pope John
        Paul
        the II. This Living Rosary was a part of his path to the priesthood.
        He
        also prayed and promoted this Rosary his entire life.

        To receive your schedule and information today, we have a table set
        up
        in the main entrance of the church, we will hand you a small signup
        sheet and pen , we ask you to please fill out the slip of paper,
        (PRINT
        CLEARLY) your first and last name, mailing address or e-mail and
        phone
        number. We have you do this for the simple reason, sometimes people
        will
        lose their schedule, so we keep track of this in our data base, so
        if
        this happens to you, we can mail or email you a new one.

        Please join us in Praying the Gospel and Changing the World!!!!!!!
        Thank you and God Love You!!!!!!!


        Thank you Father for allowing us to be here this weekend.
